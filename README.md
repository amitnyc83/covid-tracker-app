Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world. As a developer i can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API (https://covid19.mathdro.id/api). Using the information from the API i  create cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts. This project/application is created using React Hooks, Material UI, Charts.js, API data fetching using async/await functions.
